/*
The copy constructor is a constructor which creates an object by initializing it 
with an object of the same class, which has been created previously. The copy 
constructor is used to -
-Initialize one object from another of the same type.
-Copy an object to pass it as an argument to a function.
-Copy an object to return it from a function.
If a copy constructor is not defined in a class, the compiler itself defines one.
If the class has pointer variables and has some dynamic memory allocations, then 
it must have a copy constructor. The most common form of copy constructor 
is shown here -

classname (const classname &obj) {
   // body of constructor
}
Here, obj is a reference to an object that is being used to initialize another object.
